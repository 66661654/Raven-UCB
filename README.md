# RAVEN-UCB-Code
This repository contains Python scripts for generating figures in the paper "From Theory to Practice with RAVEN-UCB: Addressing Non-Stationarity in Multi-Armed Bandits through Variance Adaptation".

## Files
- `Impact_of_Variance_Distribution.py`: Generates Figure 1 (Impact of Sample Size on Mean and Variance Distributions).
- `Logistics_Simulation_Performance.py`: Generates Figure 4 (Performance Metrics in Logistics Simulation).
- `Hyperparameter_Sensitivity_Analysis.py`: Generates Figure 3 (Sensitivity Analysis of Hyperparameters \(\alpha_0\) and \(\beta_0\)).
- `Regret_Reduction_vs_Time_Horizon.py`: Generates Figure 2 (Regret Reduction as a Function of Time Horizon \(T\)).

## Usage
Run each script with Python 3.x and required libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, NumPy).
